## Project Overview

This project is my Capstone Project for Udacity's Machine Learning Eningeer Nanodegree. 
In this project, I build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, the application will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.  

The image classification is acheived using state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models.

### Instructions
Datasets for this project can be downloaded from the following links:
1. Download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/dogImages`.  The `dogImages/` folder should contain 133 folders, each corresponding to a different dog breed.
2. Download the [human dataset](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw.tgz).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/lfw`.  If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the folder. 



If your code is taking too long to run, you can switch to running your code on a GPU.  If you'd like to use a GPU, you can spin up an instance of your own:

#### Amazon Web Services

You can use Amazon Web Services to launch an EC2 GPU instance.
